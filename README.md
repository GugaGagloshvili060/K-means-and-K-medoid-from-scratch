# 🧠 K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering from Scratch

This project demonstrates the implementation of **K-Means** and **K-Medoids** clustering algorithms built entirely **from scratch in Python**, without using libraries like `scikit-learn`.  
It applies both algorithms to employee performance data to identify distinct clusters based on productivity metrics.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is **Extended Employee Performance and Productivity Data**, which includes:
- `Work_Hours_Per_Week`
- `Projects_Handled`

These features are used to group employees with similar work habits and productivity levels.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Implemented **K-Means** algorithm manually  
✅ Implemented **K-Medoids** algorithm manually  
✅ Both use **Euclidean distance** for similarity measurement  
✅ Custom convergence check for both algorithms  
✅ Visualized results using **Matplotlib**  
✅ Comparison between **centroid-based** and **medoid-based** clustering

## 📈 Visualizations

Both algorithms produce scatter plots showing employee clusters:
- Each color represents a different cluster
- Red **X** markers show **centroids** (K-Means)
- Red **X** markers show **medoids** (K-Medoids)

Example outputs include:
- *Employee Clusters (K-Means)*
- *Employee Clusters (K-Medoids)*
