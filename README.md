# K-means-and-K-medoid-from-scratch
This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Means and K-Medoids clustering algorithms built entirely from scratch in Python, without using libraries like scikit-learn. It applies both algorithms to employee performance data to identify distinct clusters based on productivity metrics.
